# Uber-Trip-Analysis

# The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015. You can do so much more with this dataset rather than just analyze it. But for now, in the section below, I will take you through Uber Trips analysis using Python.


# I am attaching Google Drive Link where people can get the dataset for analysis.
